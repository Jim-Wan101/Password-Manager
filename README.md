# Password-Manager
A simple password manager that allows for the secure storage and retrieval of passwords

## Security
The password manager encrypts passwords that are in storage using a key that is provided by the user. 

To maximise security, the user should:

- Choose a strong and unique key that is not easily guessable.
- Never share the key with anyone else
- Be aware that passwords cannot be retrieved if key is lost
